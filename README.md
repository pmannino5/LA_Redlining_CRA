# LA Redlining & CRA 

This is a python notebook with data and figures I created for a project. It charts the history of redlined neighborhoods in LA and examines the relationship between historical redlining and homeownership today.

It then examines the effect of the CRA on lending in low income neighborhoods using a regression discontinuity design.

Data for this notebook is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17G5awp9bJQib0N2NHPOvHQEfrixNCYip/view?usp=sharing
