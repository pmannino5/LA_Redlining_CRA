# la_redlining

This is a python notebook with data and figures I created for a statistics class. It charts the history of redlined neighborhoods in LA and examines the relationship between historical redlining and homeownership today.

Data for this notebook is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LpuKe5MOcZqR1AiUzIdOThmwtMRMTGm7?usp=sharing
